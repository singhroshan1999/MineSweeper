# known Issues:

- Slow due to use of Context/Provider for every cell.
- Redux should be used instead of Context/Provider.
- Some styling issues.
- Few more things to be added to setting screen.

# Notes:
- minesweeper.js in src/engine/ contains logic of game (placement of mines and DFS search to uncover empty cells)
